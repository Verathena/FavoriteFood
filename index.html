    <h1>Garri (Cassave Flakes)</h1>

    <h2>About Garri</h2>
    <p>
      It is unclear where or when Garri originated, but it is safe to say that
      Garri has existed as far back as human memory serves. Garri is made from
      fermented cassava in a long and arduous process which this recipe will not
      go into, ostensibly because it is long and arduous (as previously stated,
      in case you missed it the first time), but really because the writers do
      not know. <br />
      Garri is one of Nigeria's favorite staples, second only in popularity to
      rice. It is commonly referred to as Garium Sulphate by students in an
      attempt to make it sound scientific, even though it contains little to no
      sodium at all. Garri is beloved by <em>Saparians</em> because it is cheap,
      easy to consume and saves time. Garri slaps when it is good, is delicious,
      refreshing, and is a life-saver.<br />
      Garri is best enjoyed when it is taken with really cold water, especially
      when the temperature outside is high. There are quite a few ways to take
      Garri, depending on things like budget, how high (or low) you are on the
      sapa food chain, the color of your bank account, and ultimately your
      preference. Garri can be taken by <em>ajepakos</em> and <em>butties</em>.
      The recipe below is for entry-level or junior <em>Saparians</em>. Senior
      and C-level <em>Saparians</em> should waka pass.
